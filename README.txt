Summary    : OCaml library for arc and node graphs
URL        : http://ocamlgraph.lri.fr/
License    : LGPLv2 with exceptions
Description: Ocamlgraph provides several different implementations of graph data
           : structures. It also provides implementations for a number of classical
           : graph algorithms like Kruskal's algorithm for MSTs, topological
           : ordering of DAGs, Dijkstra's shortest paths algorithm, and
           : Ford-Fulkerson's maximal-flow algorithm to name a few. The algorithms
           : and data structures are written functorially for maximal
           : reusability. Also has input and output capability for Graph Modeling
           : Language file format and Dot and Neato graphviz (graph visualization)
           : tools.
